# Experiments

## Progressive React(16) in Angular framework
React and Vue are progressive view tools, i.e, they can be inserted into existing web pages.
For React, this is the [official example](https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-website.html)

Angular will not make itself dirty with this, however, all the "script" will not survie in angular's component.html. 

The solution here is by using **IFrame**. By putting the React Progressive html into the default route page of Angular, i.e, dashboard.component.html, the React button appeared.

# Getting Started

Super simple Angular app with 1 module and 2 routes. This is a minor variation on the Tour of Heroes for the [official docs](https://angular.io/tutorial).
